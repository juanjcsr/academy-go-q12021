# Golang Bootcamp

## Introduction

Thank you for participating in the Golang Bootcamp course!
Here, you'll find instructions for completing your certification.

## The Challenge

The purpose of the challenge is for you to demonstrate your Golang skills. This is your chance to show off everything you've learned during the course!!

You will build and deliver a whole Golang project on your own. We don't want to limit you by providing some fill-in-the-blanks exercises, but instead request you to build it from scratch.
We hope you find this exercise challenging and engaging.

The goal is to build a REST API which must include:

- An endpoint for reading from an external API
  - Write the information in a CSV file
- An endpoint for reading the CSV
  - Display the information as a JSON
- An endpoint for reading the CSV concurrently with some criteria (details below)
- Unit testing for the principal logic
- Follow conventions, best practices
- Clean architecture
- Go routines usage

## Requirements

These are the main requirements we will evaluate:

- Use all that you've learned in the course:
  - Best practices
  - Go basics
  - HTTP handlers
  - Error handling
  - Structs and interfaces
  - Clean architecture
  - Unit testing
  - CSV file fetching
  - Concurrency

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Fork this project
1. Commit periodically
1. Apply changes according to the reviewer's comments
1. Have fun!

## Deliverables

We provide the delivery dates so you can plan accordingly; please take this challenge seriously and try to make progress constantly.

For the final deliverable, we will provide some feedback, but there is no extra review date. If you are struggling with something, contact the mentors and peers to get help on time. Feel free to use the slack channel available.

## First Deliverable (due March 4th 23:59PM)

Based on the self-study material and mentorship covered until this deliverable, we suggest you perform the following:

- Create an API
- Add an endpoint to read from a CSV file
- The CSV should have any information, for example:

```txt
1,bulbasaur
2,ivysaur
3,venusaur
```

- The items in the CSV must have an ID element (int value)
- The endpoint should get information from the CSV by some field ***(example: ID)***
- The result should be displayed as a response
- Clean architecture proposal
- Use best practices
- Handle the Errors ***(CSV not valid, error connection, etc)***

> Note: whatâ€™s listed in this deliverable is just for guidance and to help you distribute your workload; you can deliver more or fewer items if necessary. However, if you deliver fewer items at this point, you have to cover the remaining tasks in the next deliverable.

## How to run

Build the code with:

```
go build . -o pokeapi
```

and run it with:

```
./pokeapi -h
```

if you run it without parameters, it will use by default the 8080 port, 
otherwise you can specify the port number:

```
./pokeapi -port 3000
```

Then the endpoint will be available at:

```
http://localhost:8088/getPoke?id=150
```
